Web site vulnerabilities check tool 
This tool is a Python script used for detecting web vulnerabilities. It searches for common vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Local File Inclusion (LFI), Remote Code Execution (RCE), Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), and XML External Entity (XXE).

To use the tool, the user needs to download the script and run it on the command line using Python. The tool is run by passing the URL address of the target website and enabling any of the available options for detecting security vulnerabilities. The results are stored in a report file called "result.txt".

To run the tool, some necessary libraries such as argparse, requests, and BeautifulSoup must be installed. These libraries can be installed using pip.

Overall, this tool provides a quick and easy way to scan a website for common vulnerabilities, which can help improve its security posture.

These tools are programmed by VIRUS_X_001.
